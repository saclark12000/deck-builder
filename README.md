# DeckBuilder

A Card Game Engine.

The general purpose of this project is to develop a versitile card game engine that a developer can use as the foundation to build thier own card games.

In order to meet the general purpose standards there are goals to obtain, listed below.

One goal of the Deckbuilder engine is to be able to have the engine generate a deck of cards from a given number of variables so that the cards can expand or contract past the typical set of cards. I.E. typical 4 suit and 13 cards in each or expanded 8 suits and 18 in each suit or reduced 2 suits with 7 cards in each suit.

Another goal of the Deckbuilder is to be able to perform standard operations on a generated deck of cards. I.E. Shuffle, deal, draw, discard for any given number of players.

Another goal of the Deckbuilder engine is for a developer to be able to pick up this engine and be able to easily apply thier own set of rules on top of it so that they can have a card game developed quickly without having to worry about deck handling operations. I.E. rules for blackjack, rules for hearts, rules for custom games, etc..
